# Cybersecurity-Portfolio
A repository where i save all the projects and differents exercises i've done with the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.
I started being interested in the cybersecurity domain less than 1 year ago. I was mindblown by everything that i learned. I'm not sure yet about what job i want to do yet because there's so much diverse jobs and aspects to the cybersecurity world but i know that i will not be bored if i get into this field. This role suits me because I have strong analytical abilities, persistence, eagerness to learn, a can-do attitude, problem-solving skills, and communication skills to address problems and emerging threats.

## Currently

I am currently pursuing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate on Coursera. This globally recognized program provides practical skills and in-depth knowledge on topics such as risk management, data protection, and network security principles.

My main goal in completing this certification is to get a job in the cybersecurity industry: prepare myself for new professional challenges, adapt to current market demands,actively contribute to securing systems within my organization. I am confident that this training will help me develop solid expertise and acquire concrete tools to protect digital infrastructures from growing threats.

## Next chapter.

After that, I would like to take the CompTIA A+, CompTIA Network+ and CompTIA Security+ certifications etc...

I have developed a cybersecurity portfolio showcasing various tasks and projects completed during my journey to earn the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. 

## Get To know me

I am currently trying to improve my written and verbal communication and i want to get better at programming too. I'm currently in a **1 year program to become Web Developper** which i think can help me discover what makes a good developer in general. I am currently learning langages like **JavaScript**, **Angular**, **PHP**, **Symfony** in my current studies. I want to use it to have a better understanding of langages like **Python**, **SQL**, **C**, **C++**, **Bash**, **Powershell** and with systems like **Linux**, **MacOs**, **Windows**. 
I would call myself a very curious person, i dont like the routine so the continuous learning in this field matches perfectly with who i am.
